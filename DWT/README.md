The DWT algorithm embeds a single watermark and detects it.

## Implementing DWT paper
The DWT algorithm [found in this paper](https://repository.tudelft.nl/file/File_21f57473-c108-46fa-94f0-c196773465b5?preview=1)
embeds and detects a singel watermark.

The algorithm is outlined in a diagram found in this repo, `diagrams/DWT_diagram`
