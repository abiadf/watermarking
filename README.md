# Watermarking
This repo focuses on a novel way to embed watermarks into timeseries.


## Datasets
- The real-world datasets (Stocks, ETTh1, Energy, and fMRI) are found in this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DI22zKWtHjXMnNGPWNUbyGz-JiEtZy6/view). First download *dataset.zip*, then unzip it
- EEG dataset is found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IqwE0wbCT1orVdZpul2xFiNkGnYs4t89/view), and should also be moved to be with the other datasets.
- MuJoCo is a simulation dataset, it will be generated when the function is called (see [TimeWak repo](https://github.com/soizhiwen/TimeWak/blob/main/Experiments/mujoco_imputation.ipynb) for more info).
Originally from [SSSD](https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/SSSD) repository. Link to [training data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pjccc2piis8g2fx/mujoco_train.npy?dl=0)
and
[test data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/spzw8pk7pho4lb1hmio6q/mujoco_test.npy?rlkey=7ucvg4g6jw9sgvze8lo8ux9da&e=1&dl=0), both numpy files.
